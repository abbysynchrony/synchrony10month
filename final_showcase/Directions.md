Create a responsive dark-themed cybersecurity portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS.

**Purpose:** I will use this as a digital showcase for my cybersecurity program. I want to manually fill in the content later.

---

## Website Requirements:

### Overall
- Use React with Tailwind CSS
- Cybersecurity-inspired dark theme
- Modern, minimalist layout
- Include section headers with emojis (leave all text as placeholders)
- Add soft hover animations to cards or tabs

---

## Page Layout

### 1. Homepage Section
- Title: “My Cybersecurity Learning Journey”
- Intro paragraph: use a generic placeholder (e.g., lorem ipsum)
- Simple visual intro (could be a centered map, animated circuit lines, or a timeline placeholder)
- Navigation menu or fixed scrollable header

---

### 2. Timeline or Section Layout
Build out a **section for each semester** of the program using the following emoji titles (don’t insert actual content yet):

- 📜 Semester 1: Cybersecurity Basics  
- 🛡 Semester 2: Network Security  
- 🧠 Semester 3: Cyber Threats and Vulnerabilities  
- 💣 Semester 4: Ethical Hacking  
- 🧪 Semester 5: Penetration Testing  
- 🔍 Semester 6: Digital Forensics

Each section should include:
- Placeholder for a short paragraph (e.g., “Summary goes here”)
- A list container for key projects (empty for now)
- A list container for tools used (empty for now)
- An empty image or card slot for visuals
- Placeholder buttons or links for downloadable files

---

### 3. Footer
- Add a basic dark-themed footer with placeholder links (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

---

### Do NOT:
- Add any project details, file names, or descriptions
- Fill in any actual content for the semesters

Just build the full structure so I can drop in the real content myself later.
